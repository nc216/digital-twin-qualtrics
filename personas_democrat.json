I do have a college education, have some income, but am limited by some other factors like not being particularly close with family or not having as good friends that I would like. I also do not have a job that I like enough to where I would like to stick with an indefinitely. It also causes me financial strain and worry about long term longevity. I have not handled all circumstances as well as I could have, but I also have not handled them as badly as what had been possible. There is a large discrepancy between the person I am now and the person I aspire to be or ought to be.\"\n\n--- WAVE 4 SURVEY RESPONSES ---\nThe following are this person's responses to additional survey questions:\n\nQuestion: Would you support or oppose...\n  Placing a tax on carbon emissions?: Somewhat support\n  Ensuring 40% of all new clean energy infrastructure development spending goes to low-income communities?: Somewhat support\n  Federal investments to ensure a carbon-pollution free electricity sector by 2035?: Strongly support\n  A \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 system in which all Americans would get healthcare from a government-run plan?: Strongly support\n  A \u2018public option\u2019, which would allow Americans to buy into a government-run healthcare plan if they choose to do so?: Strongly support\n  Immigration reforms that would provide a path to U.S. citizenship for undocumented immigrants currently in the United States?: Strongly support\n  A law that requires companies to provide paid family leave for parents?: Strongly support\n  A 2% tax on the assets of individuals with a net worth of more than $50 million?: Strongly support\n  Increasing deportations for those in the US illegally?: Somewhat oppose\n  Offering seniors healthcare vouchers to purchase private healthcare plans in place of traditional medicare coverage?: Neither oppose nor support\n\nQuestion: A panel of psychologist have interviewed and administered personality tests to 30 engineers and 70 lawyers, all successful in their respective fields.
